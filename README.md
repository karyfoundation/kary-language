KaryScript is an experimental project to bring a better syntax for more readability. That's our only goal: Readability in the code. It compiles to JavaScript. If the experiment goes well we might even integrate it to the TypeScript compiler services and let you have a powerful tooling alongside of it.

You can find some example syntaxes is the [Grammar Test Cases](https://github.com/karyfoundation/karyscript/blob/master/tests/grammar/cases.txt)

If you have any suggestions please [comment under this issue](https://github.com/karyfoundation/karyscript/issues/1)
