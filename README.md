**KaryScript is a programming language that is currently under it's initial heavy active development phase.**

My goal with the final result is to have a language that is readable (as much as possible using the backgrounds of [my research in readability](http://kary.us/2017/05/16/my-journey-to-clean-code/) and what I've collected from other languages). This is the main goal. Bringing new ways to think, new ways to express and declare and a general shape that at average is more readable than other languages. That is my main goal within this language:

KaryScript compiles to JavaScript and its compiler itself is in JavaScript and therefore it is highly portable and can be used within any modern operating system as well as any browser.
